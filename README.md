# Introduction
Webservice created using FastAPI (with Jinga2 Templates) to showcase my profile and machine learning applications accessible via browser.

This project is an opportunity to experiment with both frontend (HTML, CSS and Javascript) and backend (FastAPI). In addition, using Azure (Azure Blob Storage, Secrets ect..) and packaging the application with Docker/Kubernetes. mlflow will be embedded into the code to track additional information to AzureML remote tracking server.

I am curious to see the steps required to optimise n the scenario an endpoint is slow (i.e using KMeans Clustering)

A common interface for customers is the web browser, making it easy for a non technical audience to use machine learning applications. Ideally, an API without HTML responses is more suitable for integrating machine learning models to different interfaces (i.e OS, edge, browser and more).
